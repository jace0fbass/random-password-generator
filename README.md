https://jace0fbass.github.io/random-password-generator/


## Description

In this challenge I have added funcitionality to the webpage with Javascript. I have used prompts to have the user enter the length they want their password to be. I have used confirms to ask the user if they would like to use uppercase, lowercase, numbers, or special characters. I have defined the arrays for each text type.
